# Flint

Check your project for common sources of contributor friction.

### What to Use Flint for and When to Use It?

GitHub founder [Tom Preston-Werner][mojombo]
suggests you [should write the README before you write a single line of
code][RDD]. A well crafted README includes:

- A description of problems your project solves.
- The philosophy behind your project.
- Basic usage and getting started instructions.
- A list of comparable projects that inspired yours or would be suitable
  alternatives.
 
In addition to a README, you should include basic files that will help collaborators understand and use your project. Using Flint will help ensure these files are in place for every new project you create.

### Install

If you've got Go installed, you can install flint with Go's command line
interface:

    go get github.com/pengwynn/flint

You can test your installation by running `flint --version` from any folder.

If you don't have Go installed, you can download a [prebuilt binary for your
platform][releases], optionally renaming it to "flint" for convenience.

### Usage

Run `flint` from your project root to check for some common ways to improve the
experience for potential contributors. Here's the output for a blank folder to
show the full gamut of suggestions:

    ~/projects/dream
    ❯ flint
    [ERROR] README not found
    [INFO] Every project begins with a README. http://bit.ly/1dqUYQF
    [ERROR] CONTRIBUTING guide not found
    [INFO] Add a guide for potential contributors. http://git.io/z-TiGg
    [ERROR] LICENSE not found
    [INFO] Add a license to protect yourself and your users. http://choosealicense.com/
    [WARNING] Bootstrap script not found
    [INFO] A bootstrap script makes setup a snap. http://bit.ly/JZjVL6
    [WARNING] Test script not found
    [INFO] Make it easy to run the test suite regardless of project type. http://bit.ly/JZjVL6
    [CRITICAL] Some critical problems found.

You can also run this in older projects which were created by lazy you, or by
younger, less wise you.

If you want to check a remote GitHub repository, you can now do so without
cloning:

    ❯ flint --github pengwynn/dotfiles
    [ERROR] CONTRIBUTING guide not found
    [INFO] Add a guide for potential contributors. http://git.io/z-TiGg
    [WARNING] Test script not found
    [INFO] Make it easy to run the test suite regardless of project type. http://bit.ly/JZjVL6
    [CRITICAL] Some critical problems found.

Passing the `-h` flag will show full usage options:

    ❯ flint -h
    NAME:

### Philosophy

If you want people to use and contribute to your project, you need to start by
answering their most basic questions. Flint is a command line script that will
check your project for common answers to these questions.

#### How am I allowed to use it?

Providing the source to your project isn't enough. While you don't _have to_
provide a license, doing so will make it clear to users and potential
contributors how they can legally use your software and what happens to
contributions they make. [Choose A License][choose] can help you pick the right
license for your project.

#### How do I contribute?

You'll want to tell folks about your development workflow so they'll know how
to submit patches for bugfixes and new features. When you add [CONTRIBUTING
guidelines][contributing] to your project, GitHub will make those available at
the top of every new Pull Request screen.

#### How do I get up and running in development?

A bootstrap script is a thoughtful way to let new users (and future versions of
yourself on new hardware) get up and running quickly. A good bootstrap script
detects and installs all project dependencies. Don't make your less technical
users learn devops. Make it as easy as running `script/bootstrap`.

#### How do I make sure my new features didn't break old functionality?

Good software projects have test suites that ensure the code works as
advertised. Even within language communities, there can be a myriad of test
frameworks. You can make it easy to run the test suite with a platform agnostic
`script/test` executable.
